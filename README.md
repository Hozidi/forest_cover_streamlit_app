# forest_cover_streamlit_app
This project implements a forest cover type classifier using machine learning to predict the type of forest cover based on cartographic variables. The model is built using scikit-learn and deployed as an interactive app with Streamlit, allowing users to visualize predictions and gain insights into how various factors influence forest cover.
